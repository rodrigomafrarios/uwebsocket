# uwebsocket

Being meticulously optimized for speed and memory footprint, ÂµWebSockets is fast enough to do encrypted TLS 1.3 messaging quicker than most alternative servers can do even unencrypted, cleartext messaging[3].
Furthermore, we partake in Google's OSS-Fuzz with a ~95% daily fuzzing coverage with no sanitizer issues. LGTM scores us flawless A+ from having zero CodeQL alerts.
